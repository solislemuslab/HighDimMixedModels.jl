## Overview 
HighDimMixedModels.jl is a package for fitting regularized linear mixed-effect models on high-dimensional omics data. These models can be used to analyze hierarchical, high dimensional data, especially useful for situations in which the number of predictors exceeds the number of samples ($p > n$). 

For fitting the model, the package implements the coordinate gradient descent algorithm found in

>Schelldorfer, Jürg, Peter Bühlmann, and SARA VAN DE GEER. "Estimation for high‐dimensional linear mixed‐effects models using ℓ1‐penalization." Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 38.2 (2011): 197-214.

and 

>Ghosh, A., & Thoresen, M. (2018). Non-concave penalization in linear mixed-effect models and regularized selection of fixed effects. AStA Advances in Statistical Analysis, 102, 179-210. 

Because of its superior estimation performance, the *smoothly clipped absolute deviation* (SCAD) is the default penalty, but the $\ell_1$ penalty (LASSO) proposed in the original source is also available.
